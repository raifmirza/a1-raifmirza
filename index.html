Early Life

Quentin Tarantino was born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee. He is the only7

 child of Connie McHugh, who is part Cherokee and part Irish, and actor Tony Tarantino, who left the
 family before Quentin was born.

Moving to California at the age of 4, Tarantino developed his love for movies at an 7
early age. One of his earliest memories is of his grandmother taking him to see a John Wayne movie.
 Tarantino also loved storytelling, but he showed his creativity in unusual ways. "He wrote me sad
  Mother's Day stories. He'd always kill me and tell me how bad he felt about it," Connie once told
   Entertainment Weekly. "It was enough to bring a tear to a mother's eye."


Tarantino loathed school, choosing to spend his time watching movies or reading comics 7
rather than studying. The only subject that appealed to him was history. "History was cool and I
did well there, because it was kind of like the movies," he told Entertainment Weekly. After dropping
out of high school, Tarantino worked as an usher at a adult film theater for a time. He also took acting
classes. Tarantino eventually landed a job at Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, California. There he
worked with Roger Avary, who shared his passion for film. The two even worked on some script
 ideas together.
Early Films

True Romance and Natural Born Killers. He also landed a guest spot on the popular sitcom The Golden
Girls, playing an Elvis impersonator. In 1990, Tarantino left Video Archives to work for Cinetel, a
 production company. Through one of the producers there, he was able to get his script for True Romance
  in the hands of director Tony Scott. Scott liked Tarantino's script, and bought the rights to it.

Working with producer Lawrence Bender, Tarantino was able to secure funding for his 7
directorial debut, Reservoir Dogs (1992), for which he had also written the screenplay. Actor Harvey
Keitel was impressed when he read the script, saying "I haven't seen characters like these in years."
He signed on as an actor and a producer for the project. Other cast members included Michael Madsen, Tim
Roth, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi and Tarantino himself.

In 1992, audiences at the Sundance Film Festival were entranced by Reservoir Dogs, 7
Tarantino's ultraviolent crime caper gone wrong. He drew inspiration for the project from such classic
heist films as Rififi and City on Fire. The independent film helped make Tarantino one of the most
talked-about figures in Hollywood. While not a big hit in the United States, it became a popular title on
video and did well overseas.
